                  Clients have relied on Presidio Cost Solutions to prepare,
                  analyze, and resolve their construction claims and disputes.
                  In addition, clients and their attorneys have called on
                  Presidio Cost Solutionsâ€™s experts to perform forensic analysis
                  of construction projects to determine liability for increased
                  cost, reduced labor productivity, defects, and schedule
                  delays.

                    uses a client-centric approach to ensure that our clients
                    are aware of our effort, deliverable progress, and turnover
                    timelines at each and every stage in the process. Using
                    client engagement platforms like Microsoft Power BI ensure
                    that our clients have 24-hr access to the estimates and

                    You're absolutely right; each client has a unique operating
                    environment which requires a careful attention to direct and
                    indirect cost details. We commence our engagement with new
                    clients with a 'cost calibration period' to help isolate any
                    direct-cost variance with material and labor. While we have
                    tried-and-true methods for extending indirect costs and
                    general expenses, we believe in approaching these remaining
                    items in close collaboration with our clients.
