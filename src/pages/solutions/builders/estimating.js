                  Accurate MEP estimating requires thoughtful attention to
                  project requirements, system experience, familiarity with
                  local Code, and regional market pricing insights. It's tough
                  for today's owners, developers and general contractors to
                  navigate the changing technologies and regulations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  General contractors are faced with a continually fluctuating
                  market which makes it frustrating to maintain reliable and
                  consistent workloads throughout the year. In todayâ€™s
                  environment of economic pullback, the construction trades are
                  seeing major cuts and contractors must do more with less. The
                  contracting industry as whole has always been subject to the
                  whims of commodity cost changes, local market conditions, and
                  the never-ending cycle of subcontractors; but with the current
                  resources, lack of training, and dwindling labor pool,
                  recovery in the construction sector may take years.
