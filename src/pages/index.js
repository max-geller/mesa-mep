          What We Do Clients have relied on Presidio MEP to prepare, analyze,
          and resolve their construction claims and disputes. In addition,
          clients and their attorneys have called on Presidio MEPâ€™s experts to
          perform forensic analysis of construction projects to determine
          liability for increased cost, reduced labor productivity, defects, and
          schedule delays. Clients benefit from the comprehensive evaluation and
          professional presentation that Presidio MEP provides on each
          assignment. Our experts assist clients with divesting, restructuring,
          improving, and acquiring firms involved in engineering and
          construction. Whether supplying key project management personnel on
          work sites, or supporting project management efforts from our home
          office, clients depend on Presidio MEP when a positive change or
          action is required. Design Consulting Cost Estimating Cost Analytics
